# Cybersecurity | OSINT & Digital Investigations

Welcome! 

I‚Äôm a Brazilian cybersecurity professional specialized in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), Digital Investigations, and Threat Analysis. My focus is clear: turning information into actionable intelligence.

I have hands-on experience in the collection and preservation of digital evidence, application of the intelligence cycle, social media investigations (SOCMINT), image geolocation (GEOINT), and advanced use of OSINT tools.

I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from UniCesumar, with a strong foundation in software engineering, C++, Python, and Java (OOP). During my academic period, I spent two years in technical internships, building real-world skills in computer networks, hardware maintenance, and user support.

I‚Äôm **BTJA-certified** (Blue Team Junior Analyst), trained in digital forensics, threat hunting, network analysis, and operations in complex environments such as the dark web. I also hold Offensive Security certifications with a focus on web vulnerabilities and tools like Burp Suite.

My real-world investigation cases include:

- Profiling and tracking a Facebook scammer targeting marketplace users  
- Background investigation of a real estate consultant (reputation and identity verification)  
- Locating a stalker based on visual clues extracted from a single cover photo  

I‚Äôm also an active participant in Bug Bounty programs, both on private Brazilian platforms and internationally (Intigriti), constantly sharpening my Red Team and investigative techniques.

This portfolio showcases my technical capabilities, casework experience, and my commitment to producing results through responsible digital intelligence.

**I am open to projects, partnerships, or opportunities within Cybersecurity ‚Äî with a strong preference for Digital Investigations and OSINT.**
