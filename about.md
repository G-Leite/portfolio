# About Me

I'm a Brazilian cybersecurity practitioner specialized in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), digital investigations, and threat analysis.

I hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from UniCesumar, where I built my foundation in software engineering, programming (C++, Python, and Java with OOP), and technical logic.

During my academic period, I interned for two years, developing hands-on skills in computer networks, hardware maintenance, and user support.

But I found my true focus in cybersecurity â€” especially OSINT.

I've conducted real-world digital investigations, including:
- Profiling and tracking a Facebook scammer targeting marketplace users
- Background research on a real estate consultant, including reputation and identity verification
- Investigating a stalker and confirming their location using only visual clues from a cover photo

I'm also an active bug bounty researcher, participating in a private Brazilian platform and Intigriti.

This portfolio reflects my technical capabilities, cases handled, and my commitment to responsible digital intelligence.
