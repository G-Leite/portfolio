description: Cybersecurity professional specialized in OSINT and Digital Investigations. I have real-world experience in the collection and preservation of digital evidence, application of the intelligence cycle, digital analysis techniques, social media investigations (SOCMINT), image geolocation (GEOINT), and advanced use of OSINT tools. I hold the Blue Team Junior Analyst (BTJA) certification, where I enhanced my knowledge in digital forensics, threat hunting, network analysis, and operations in complex environments such as the dark web. I also hold Offensive Security certifications focused on web vulnerabilities and tools such as Burp Suite. I actively participate in Bug Bounty programs and continuously seek to improve my Red Team techniques. I am looking for opportunities in projects, partnerships, or positions in Cybersecurity, especially in the areas of Digital Investigations and OSINT.
